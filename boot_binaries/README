1. Initial MinnowBoard provisioning
===================================

These steps are required the first time you are flashing a Brillo build.

On the Linux PC, insert a USB thumb drive. Determine the correct device name
for the USB thumb drive. In a terminal window, enter the following command:
  $ dmesg | tail -20

In the resulting output, look for a name such as [sdX], where X is a letter.
Unmount any partitions that were automatically mounted, using the following
command, where X is the letter identified above:
  $ sudo umount /dev/sdX*

Write fastboot-usb.img to the USB thumb drive using the following commands,
where X is the letter identified above:
  # Note: This command will overwrite the content of the USB thumb drive.
  $ sudo dd bs=1M if=fastboot-usb.img of=/dev/sdX conv=fsync

Eject the USB thumb drive and connect it to the MinnowBoard.
  $ sudo eject /dev/sdX

Insert a MicroSD card (4GB or larger) in the on-board MicroSD port.
Connect the MinnowBoard to the same DHCP-enabled network your Linux host is
connected. Power on the MinnowBoard.
Press F2 or ESC while booting to enter the Device Manager.
Use the arrow keys to select Boot Manager and press Enter.
Use the arrow keys to select EFI USB Device and press Enter.
Wait for the MinnowBoard to boot in fastboot.

See the next section for actually flashing your build.

2. Flashing Brillo on MinnowBoard
=================================

Follow these steps if you flashed at least once a Brillo build before or you
booted from a USB drive as described in Section 1.
If you already have a Brillo OS build running on the device issue:
  $ adb reboot bootloader
which will get you in fastboot mode.

After fastboot has started, the monitor displays an ethernet address for the
MinnowBoard, such as "Fastboot is listening on TCP <fastboot_ip>:5554"
as shown in the output below:

-- cut --
Bootlogic: Check reboot target...
checking LoaderEntryOneShot
target = bootloader
Bootlogic: selected 'Fastboot mode'

INSECURE BOOTLOADER - SYSTEM SECURITY IN RED STATE
entering Fastboot mode
OEMLock not set, device is in provisioning mode
Unable to locate graphics output protocol, graphic disabled: Not Found
Init screen failed: Not Found
Fastboot UI initialization failed, continue anyway.: Not Found
Failed to locate usb device protocol
USB for fastboot transport layer is not supported, skipping
Fastboot is listening on TCP 10.10.1.5:5554
TCP for fastboot transport layer selected
-- cut --

Record the TCP/IP address <fastboot_ip> in a convenient place. You'll need
this value in the next step. On the Linux PC, in a terminal window where you
sourced the build enviroment from a Brillo AOSP tree, enter the following
command to start the provisioning process:

  $ provision -s tcp:<fastboot_ip>
  $ fastboot -s tcp:<fastboot_ip> reboot

The board is restarted and Brillo is installed on the MicroSD card.
You may remove the USB thumb drive if it was inserted. This completes the
installation and bring-up procedures. Your MinnowBoard is ready for use.

3. Rebuild bootloader and fastboot-usb.img
==========================================

In order to rebuild the image used for initial provisioning and/or the
bootloader you need a full Brillo AOSP development tree. Presuming that you
already downloaded the AOSP tree under /brillo folder, the next steps are to
download the bootloader source code and its dependencies, change a flag in
BoardConfig.mk and make a full or partial build.
To download the required sources we add a local_manifest.xml and use repo tool
for integrating them in the development tree. From a terminal console run the
following commands:

  $ cd /brillo
  $ mkdir -p .repo/local_manifests
  $ cp vendor/bsp/intel/minnowboard/boot_binaries/local_manifest.xml .repo/local_manifests/
  $ repo sync -j4 -c

After the sync in $TOP/vendor/bsp/intel folder you should see 4 new projects.

By default MinnowBoard configuration files are set to use a prebuilt bootloader.
If you want to rebuild the bootloader from sources then you have to set the
BOOTLOADER_USE_PREBUILT environment variable to false before executing make.
After making your changes in the kernelflinger project you rebuild it with these commands:

  $ cd /brillo
  $ source build/envsetup.sh
  $ lunch minnowboard-eng
  $ rm -rf out/
  $ BOOTLOADER_USE_PREBUILT=false make -j8 bootloader fastboot-usb

The new binaries are created in the out/target/product/minnowboard/ folder:
out/target/product/minnowboard/bootloader
out/target/product/minnowboard/fastboot-usb.img

IMPORTANT: remove the out/ folder before building with BOOTLOADER_USE_PREBUILT=false
IMPORTANT: you must move them to the vendor/bsp/intel/minnowboard/boot_binaries/
folder in order to be used by the build system:

  $ cd brillo
  $ cp out/target/product/minnowboard/bootloader vendor/bsp/intel/minnowboard/boot_binaries/
  $ cp out/target/product/minnowboard/fastboot-usb.img vendor/bsp/intel/minnowboard/boot_binaries/
  $ rm -rf out/ # if you build without BOOTLOADER_USE_PREBUILT=false

If you want a USER build instead of ENGINEERING one then use
'lunch minnowboard-user' in the above commands. If you want a full image build
for MinnowBoard then use 'make -j8 dist'.

4. Recreate the binaries from an AOSP revision manifest
=======================================================

In the previous section you rebuilt the bootloader sources in your local AOSP
tree which may be different from the snapshot used when the original binaries
were published. Usually you do not need to do this and the previous section should
be enough for most cases unless you need the exact binaries or you are having problems
building.

To recreate the exact binaries you need to download the 'full_manifest_2016-04-01.xml' file from:
https://github.com/01org/brillo-minnowboard-binaries/tree/brillo-manifests. Then run:
  $ repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/brillo/manifest -b master -m full_manifest_2016-05-18.xml
  $ repo sync

You can now follow the instructions from the previous section to build the images.
