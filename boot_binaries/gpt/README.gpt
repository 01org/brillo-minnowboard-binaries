If you want to regenerate gpt.bin which is used for flashing the GPT partition
table on a Brillo provisioned Intel Minnowboard device:
   - make your changes in the sample gpt.ini provided
   - run:
      $ python gpt_ini2bin.py gpt.ini > gpt.bin
   - If you want to flash from an existing BDK tree:
       - copy the resulting gpt.bin in vendor/bsp/intel/minnowboard/boot_binaries
   - If you are flashing from an existing flashfiles and vendor archive, just replace gpt.bin with the new one.
   - Follow the standard BDK documentation for flashing a device:
      e.g $ provision (from a BDK tree) or the brillo-flashall.sh script from an archive.
